# SwiftBar plugin: fix the grammar/spelling of the currently selected text in
# place, using an on-device language model. It keeps your wording and voice and
# only nudges wording when something is clearly wrong.
#
# Trigger it two ways: click "Fix" in the menu, or press the global hotkey.
# On trigger: save the clipboard, copy the selection, run it through the engine,
# paste the result back, then restore the clipboard.

# The compiled engine is installed beside this plugin in a hidden .lib/ folder
# (so SwiftBar doesn't try to run it as its own plugin). Resolve it relative to
# this script so the plugin works wherever SwiftBar's plugin folder is.
